description: Mined NYC taxi ride data by querying database using SQLite. Conducted exploratory data analysis, inspection, and cleaning using SQL. Created training and validation datasets for future use. Continued exploration on training dataset. Visualized and analyzed time, distance, and spatial/locational features. Implemented clustering
analysis to pinpoint more nuanced features. Completed feature engineering and constructed regression model for the purpose of predicting the duration of an NYC taxi ride based on given information. Fit the model on training data, validated, and tested. Built reusable data processing pipeline. Model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 176, meaning it was off by roughly 2-4 minutes for an average taxi ride.
